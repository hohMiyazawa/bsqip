Header:
	unsigned 2 byte integer, image width - 1.
	unsigned 2 byte integer, image height - 1.
	4 bits, reserved.
	2 bits, SVG shape format. 00=triangles, 01=rectangles, 10=circles
	2 bits, colour format. 00=8bit greyscale, 01=8bit colour, 10=16bit truecolour, 11=24bit rgb
	unsigned 1 byte integer, shape opacity, as 256ths - 1.
	background colour, either 1, 2 or 3 bytes depending on colour format

Every group of bytes after that:
	shape colour: 1, 2 or 3 bytes depending on colour format
	shape coordinates: 3, 4 or 6 bytes depending on shape

Triangles:
	uses an image scaled to 128.
	every triangle coordinates is a 1 byte integer - 63
	(x1,y1)(x2,y2)(x3,y3)

Rectangles:
	uses an image scaled to 256
	every rectangle coordnate is a 1 byte unsigned integer
	x,y,width,height
	(width and height are represented as their values - 1)

Circles:
	uses an image scaled to 256
	every circle coordinate is a 1 byte unsigned integer
	x,y,r
